Hello, thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me today. So we have been spending quite a lot of time looking into e-commerce platforms, hyper-personalization of commerce and basically which opportunities will machine learning open up in this space. And so we really wanted to speak to someone who had an important position at some of the biggest companies in the space to understand.
Mainly my questions are like the biggest opportunities that you see in machine learning in this context of hyper-personalized commerce. And who do you think are going to be the winners? And how do you see the incumbents like Shopify, Magento responding to this? Or do you think there is space for startups to emerge here and capitalize only on like product recommendation or optimized search or improve checkout experience and all these different parts of the value chain?
FORMER DATA SCIENCE LEAD AT SHOPIFY
So let's start with biggest opportunities first. So a good place to look is like what have the big platforms done, like Amazon, I think there's like different marketplaces that are more popular in other countries like India and Asia, and you could look at what they're doing.
But this is their business. They have massive data teams. So they invest. You can kind of rely on them to leave no stone unturned in terms of like opportunity for applications. So if you look at Amazon, for example, the very obvious example they've done is product recommendation. Now that becomes much more important for merchants who have like huge catalogs, with tons of different products.
If a merchant has a small subset of products, and they have like one or two main products that sell, that won't be that valuable to them. But product recommendations is like a big one, obviously, both can live, both on like the home page of a store. And then where you'll typically see that in checkout is using something called upsell.
So when someone reaches the end of the cart experience, you will serve them a recommendation of like other things that may go well with their product and you potentially mix in, it's down as well to incentivize them. So I kind of bucket those, maybe it's the whole separate things like product recommendations and like checkout experience or upsell, but I kind of think of those as the same thing based on what we know about this customer, what products should we recommend to them?
Either when they haven't put anything in their cart or when they already have things in their cart. So that's one. And then search is obviously one that a lot of people invest heavily in because it's where people look for products and today, I think, it has the most opportunity given recent advances with different kind of AI.
And machine learning techniques because algorithms have gotten much better at taking meaning behind what humans are asking for and then translating that into results. And not kind of relying on having an exact kind of text phrase match in order to surface the results.
And then like in terms of what would actually be like most valuable to merchants, from my experience, like we talked to a lot of them when I was at Shopify. And they care about sales and they care about saving time, right? So if something could either get them more money or make them spend less time on something, then that will be valuable to them.
So I'm just trying to think like we've talked about all these things that might get them more sales. That's what they care a lot about. But if there is things that can help them on the time saving front with respect to like all the different things they have to do, like something that my team worked on was we worked on cross-border commerce. So selling it overseas. And a big problem there was merchants, actually, this is also true for domestic commerce.
You often have to categorize your products for tax purposes. So doing that is really time consuming for merchants and hard like they have to go research all these different tax codes and try and pick from like 10,000 categories, which thing applies to their product. So that's another kind of opportunity and space that we worked within Shopify product categorization. That's an example of like saving time.
TEGUS CLIENT
I guess also enhancing like product descriptions and so on, like being the intersection in the product information management, right? If you have an algorithm that can scrape, I don't know, an old website that you had and create a new one using Genamel and describing what you see in the inventories and so on and can create all these like product description and so on also from the infrastructure side, not only for like the end user, but this would save money, save time to the merchant, who are the developers there.
FORMER DATA SCIENCE LEAD AT SHOPIFY
Yes. I could see someone taking ChatGPT and saying like, describe this image. Like I'm sure that will exist in the coming days, yes.
TEGUS CLIENT
For instance, we have spoken to a company that's using their own machine learning models and connecting to existing LLMs, is scraping like Etsy website and then it's creating a new front end experience using kind of a ChatGPT feature to enrich the descriptions and so on.
FORMER DATA SCIENCE LEAD AT SHOPIFY
So there's interesting opportunities there, so the value I see in that is if I'm a merchant, like that's going to save me time. I don't have to think about writing a product description from scratch. This AI spits out description and then maybe I tweak it and like take out some parts I do want or like I use that as a starting point rather than a blank slate. That could be useful.
I don't know how much someone would pay for that, like maybe big companies or maybe big merchants who have like hundreds of thousands of products, and they don't want to pay like a copywriter to do that, maybe they have an AI do it, and then they have one person instead of 10 people who just like edits what the AI spit out. There's definitely opportunity there.
In my mind, the opportunity for that is like in terms of value is how many like humans did you automate away? Or how much time did you save the owner, if it's just one person. Whereas with like sales, if you're doing something that improves conversion and it's quantifiable, that potentially could work a lot more.
TEGUS CLIENT
And did you see while you were at Shopify then putting a lot of effort into implementing ML and optimizing some of these pain points?
FORMER DATA SCIENCE LEAD AT SHOPIFY
Yes. So like Shopify's business model is very much aligned with if we do things to make merchants more successful, we're more successful, right? Because they make a percentage cut of the merchant's revenue. Also, just if merchants make more money, they're more likely to stay longer on the platform and continue to pay, just in case. So like Shopify will do anything that makes merchants more successful.
So yes, they knew that search and things like product recommendations were important. Search was a bigger focus, product recommendations, I don't think there was a huge focus on. I think Shopify also has a general philosophy of like, things that are probably more niche and may not be used by all merchants, they will offload to the partner ecosystem. So they will let app developers come in and build on top of their platform and sell their apps instead.
So product recommendations, I could see being a more of a slightly nicher ML opportunity compared to search. And that kind of being a play for where someone in the ecosystem could take advantage of this. But with that said, the platform of building apps on Shopify is becoming much more flexible. More merchants are moving to headless BI or headless e-commerce solutions, which means they build their own website and they use Shopify APIs or the management of that.
TEGUS CLIENT
So what's your view on commerce platforms like Saleor from Poland, Commerce Layer in Italy or fabric in the U.S.?
FORMER DATA SCIENCE LEAD AT SHOPIFY
I have not heard of the two you mentioned. Are they headless BI solutions?
TEGUS CLIENT
So independently of those names, what's your view on other headless commerce platforms?
FORMER DATA SCIENCE LEAD AT SHOPIFY
I think unless they're building on Shopify, like, I'm not sure what their competitive advantage will be and why someone would go with them as opposed to Shopify. Shopify supports headless commerce.
TEGUS CLIENT
I don't know, for instance, less than $10 million revenues that don't need to customize their experiences or don't need a very flexible development experience because they're okay with what they have.
FORMER DATA SCIENCE LEAD AT SHOPIFY
They work with a lot of huge merchants, and they're like making a big focus on going even further up enterprise. So sure, like I would need to look at all these solutions and see, but it's possible today that like some of these are like maybe have some APIs that are slightly more flexible and like maybe appeal to larger companies.
But if you're a big company and you're looking to build a headless site, like the first name you're going to go look at is Shopify. It's also not just like the features they offer. It's so much more than that. It's like what level of support are you going to get? What about like the rest of the partner ecosystem?
Like Shopify's partner ecosystem is massive. I don't know if you've read Ben Thompson, his Stratechery newsletter, like he defines platforms as people that the ecosystem makes more money than the thing, and that's the case of Shopify, like their partners and apps ecosystem makes more money than Shopify.
TEGUS CLIENT
I spoke to another Shopify specialist and he mentioned that Shopify makes 90% of its revenues at checkouts and only 10% in subscription. And so that they would be now more focused on the whole checkout experience and blocking anyone else building up in checkout that is trying to get the revenue from their sites basically. And then focus to capitalize more on checkout and less so let third-party apps interfere there. And maybe put less focus on the whole website building and experience and all of that.
FORMER DATA SCIENCE LEAD AT SHOPIFY
So I don't know if those numbers are correct. With respect to checkout, Shopify needs to process the transactions, right? So basically, what happens is there's a bunch of apps that were taken over checkout by injecting JavaScript. And when you click the button to like go, A, it basically took you to their website instead of Shopify.
It's not just monetary reasons that Shopify wants to control checkout like, if they don't do checkout, the whole merchant experience is much worse as well because they don't collect all the necessary data they necessarily need to post business buyer journey stuff. There's a number of other reasons. They still let people build and do checkout, you can build an upsell app or like a checkout customization app and put that in the checkouts. But you're not going to process the payment.
And that's what apps wanted for money is the payment processing because that's where you have high volume, low margin, but high volume. So you make a lot of money. So those are some of the most successful apps ones that hijacked checkouts. They were able to convince merchants to use their product because they had a customized checkout experience, but I think the way they made money is through all the transaction fees they got.
It wasn't like they were saying don't know, maybe there's some that do this now. We'll charge you $10,000 a month for like this upsell experience. And then Shopify takes all the transaction fees. The challenge with those business models, I think and like our business is in a similar point, where like across these platforms you have to clearly show the value your product is generating.
And that can be hard, unless there's like a very clear spike in sales, after the person turns the product on, then the merchant won't be able to see it. So even for example, if they're giving a merchant 2% more sales, like that is very hard. That's a lot of money over time. That's very hard to see if a merchant is staring at a sales graph, that's like very noisy.
I've looked at hundreds of these things. And it's like very noisy to try and decipher like did it go up 1% because it's like people are running campaigns. There's a big spike. There's a new fashion drop and then it spikes up and it's like did it spike up because this product recommendation thing or did it spike up because we just did this massive sale. So it can be very hard to figure those out.
Coming back to the original thing is like your point was, will Shopify not focus on website experience? No, that's not true. Like actually I'm not sure since I left how much they're investing in like the website like Dragon Drop.
TEGUS CLIENT
I understand yes they have like their themes and so on, which can be great if I have a business, a brand selling like, I don't know, making $2 million in GMV, or $5 million GMV. But if I'm the likes of Nike, for instance, and I want to have product drops and I want to have collaborations and I want to have so on and so on, and I have a whole team of engineers and developers that can go to me all these applications specific to my needs.
It makes more sense that I go for these big enterprise clients, I go with headless solution, maybe open source like for instance, Saleor, the one I mentioned is open source and then you can plug in to all the different integrations that you like versus with Shopify, you can only plug in to the integrations within the Shopify landscape.
Like it is modular enough for young merchants or for smaller merchants, but we're speaking about the big enterprise clients, they need more flexibility and customization and being more on top of the customer journey and so on. There is room for headless, right? Otherwise, there wouldn't exist any headless commerce platforms.
FORMER DATA SCIENCE LEAD AT SHOPIFY
Shopify has headless offerings.
TEGUS CLIENT
Yes. Shopify Plus, right?
FORMER DATA SCIENCE LEAD AT SHOPIFY
I'm not sure actually on the plan differentiation, who can use headless and who cannot. It may be possible for smaller merchants to use it as well. But when you use Shopify's headless, I don't know the rules for this, but I very much doubt that you could plug in a different checkout solution, right? Like you probably saw if you use Shopify's checkout. So yes, you're limited to the plug-ins that are available in the Shopify ecosystem. It depends on like how big the gaps are.
But it depends how big these open-source solutions are and how many people they have, but I would be very skeptical of like just grabbing some low traction or like not widely used open-source integration to run my very important business, they're still going to look to Shopify. And I will say like it's possible there's a gap today in terms of flexibility, but like Shopify is making a clear push upmarket, like they just announced something, Commerce Components.
They're making a clear push up towards this market that's where the money is. I'm sure they're under pressure to drive more revenue with their stock. And that's where the money is. So like if there is a gap, they're going to focus on closing that and keep kind of building these more integrations or encouraging the partners in their ecosystem to build the missing integrations that people using headless are looking for.
TEGUS CLIENT
Apart from the startups that I mentioned, you have some other like long-standing players like BigCommerce, right? It is like a publicly-traded company, a big headless commerce solution and so on. But the appearance of all these other new headless platforms like Commerce Layer as well, they already raised 50 million.
But the thing is that they say that BigCommerce, you still need an army of engineers and developers to do all these integrations, whereas with Commerce Layer or some other like open-source platforms, they're more accessible for mid-merchants, not the likes of the big enterprise but like for mid to the higher merchants. What else? So any other insights on like Shopify's focus in terms of e-commerce strategy more technically?
FORMER DATA SCIENCE LEAD AT SHOPIFY
I think their focus is on the really like the merchant's top pain point. So fulfillment is a huge one, right? Look at what the acquisitions have been right? It's all like delivery, fulfillment network.
TEGUS CLIENT
This is part of what the other guy told me, like they are going to focus on checkout and fulfillment. They're going to fully capitalize on that to make it their own and then they must shift their focus from pure like website builder experience kind of thing.
FORMER DATA SCIENCE LEAD AT SHOPIFY
I mean the website building experience has not been a major focus for a long time, right? Like it's not great. They should have bought Webflow like early on. But there will be niches there or like things where partners can come in and build better website building experiences. But like keep in mind, they're just taking a small portion of what Shopify does, right, which could be like a sizable market.
TEGUS CLIENT
You can fill this blank into Shopify's front end, and then improve the front-end experience or something else, but still be blank with Shopify.
FORMER DATA SCIENCE LEAD AT SHOPIFY
In terms of investments, I would personally invest in companies that are working in the Shopify ecosystem but working on something that's not a main focus or a weak point for them. So this area is not oversaturated, and I wouldn't look at it. But as an example, there have been a lot of really successful companies in the analytics space because Shopify's analytics product is horrible.
So that's a good example of where like apps can have a lot of success is where things aren't a key focus for Shopify. So if someone made a better website builder that kind of used Shopify's APIs and was more intuitive, that would obviously be a good area of focus. However, that would probably be like the lower end of the market, right, where smaller merchants.
Like the Nikes, for example, they have a team that would custom design their thing and like could build it, right? And they would do headless. So that would be more of a long-tail solution that would have to be like lower priced to make sure the cost counts as merchants are willing to fork over another $30 a month on top of their stuff, $30 a month or whatever to pay for that.
Like, I'm just thinking. The other big space fulfillment is with like all the Apple privacy changes, it's much harder for merchants to do targeted advertising. So the cost of acquisition has gone up for their customers. So Shopify is focused on how can we get merchants more customers?
And that's where you see the Shop App, they're making a big push with that because it's essentially like they won't call it this, but it's essentially like a marketplace for Shopify stores, right? And that's really valuable because that's like Amazon's biggest moat, right, is they bring all these merchants, tons and tons of customers. Shopify doesn't bring merchants any customers, right?
Merchants are on their own and they give them some tools. Merchants are on their own to go find customers. And that's one of the biggest challenges merchants face. So that will always be a big investment for them, is how do we get our merchants more customers? And that's where like initiatives like the Shop App can help because they can kind of get all these buyers and send them recommendations or let them discover these merchants they never would have heard of before. So I think that will be a big focus for them as well.
TEGUS CLIENT
This is also Shopify would ever get into customer support and optimization there in machine learning be it the chat bots or audio?
FORMER DATA SCIENCE LEAD AT SHOPIFY
So they do have a product, what's it called? Shopify Inbox, I think it's called. It is a chat app that they kind of give out of the box. But like I'm sure that another company could build a better like customer support experience, I mean AI and move quicker than Shopify would. And not to be like a case where Shopify would just buy them if it was good enough. So yes, like Shopify doesn't get strategic acquisitions from their portfolio of apps.
TEGUS CLIENT
What do you think also about customer success? I think this ties as well as helping merchant's sell more, it's different than marketing tech. But customer success like guiding your customers to the platform, getting some insights on which users are more valuable and you should help upsell or helping reduce or predict churn and so on. Like for instance, there is a company called Planhat, it's a Nordic or some wouldn't get this, it's outside of the Shopify scope, right? But have you heard of any of these customer success?
FORMER DATA SCIENCE LEAD AT SHOPIFY
I'm not familiar with them, but just from my gut, I'm not very bullish on like the opportunity there. Like just think about your own experience, buying stuff online, I don't really want the merchant to keep like e-mailing me and upselling me with like new opportunities. I find that annoying. I'm just not sure what opportunity is there to like really squeeze more out of customers or the churn doesn't really make sense unless it's like one of the e-commerce companies that does subscription services.
TEGUS CLIENT
Yes, no, this is not probably for like products, right, this can only be for SaaS and customer success, not only for like e-commerce selling like B2C products or more broadly.
FORMER DATA SCIENCE LEAD AT SHOPIFY
This is outside of Shopify?
TEGUS CLIENT
Yes.
FORMER DATA SCIENCE LEAD AT SHOPIFY
Yes. I mean, it only makes sense for companies with like thousands and millions of customers, right? Where like getting a 1% lower churn rate actually makes a huge difference for your business.
TEGUS CLIENT
Do you have anything else to add in this matter otherwise?
FORMER DATA SCIENCE LEAD AT SHOPIFY
So in terms of focus, I think we hit like the big areas. Just as a general principle, always think about like what are things that like every merchant absolutely needs and what will make Shopify's platform more defensible and make them more money. And now increasingly, what will big enterprises look for. And if it ticks those boxes, that would be a big focus for Shopify.
But like look at the companies they'll talk about their biggest customers. So they love to talk about Allbirds, for example, because they're a public company and they are up on Shopify. There are other big brands they talk about like Fashion Nova and all these other ones. But you'd only be able to get their sales, if those companies, like Allbirds obviously disclose their sales. Gymshark is another one they talk a lot about. So generally speaking, like their big customers, they all talk about a lot publicly.
So yes, I kind of shared my view of like what Shopify will build is like, yes, things that make sense for all merchants or things that make sense for enterprise customers, things that will generate them a lot more money. They'll leave the smaller niches and incremental improvements to like the app ecosystem.
And coming back to the machine learning piece, like I shared that the biggest places, I think, where there's opportunity are like search product recommendations. Again, I think these are hard products to sell stand-alone and make a lot of money off of.
TEGUS CLIENT
I think it needs to be all integrated into like one platform.
FORMER DATA SCIENCE LEAD AT SHOPIFY
Yes. But I think the opportunity for someone like that is Shopify just buys them, right? Like Shopify acquired some company purely for their like expertise and talent with like search and product categorization, right? I don't even know what kind of sales they had or what kind of product they had. So that is an opportunity there.
I don't know what kind of exits you're looking for on your portfolio, it's not going to be like an IPO, but like you may get a decent return, or maybe like in the tens of millions, if it's a good product that Shopify will buy. So that's kind of how I think about opportunities in those spaces is like with machine learning, like maybe they would buy them and integrate them into their platform.
TEGUS CLIENT
We're more looking for big platforms that can compete with Shopify and not be acquired like them, like an Algolia kind of thing that dominates search and discovery for instance. And what is going to be the next headless commerce platform that is going to substitute BigCommerce, which is really technical.
And everyone's feedback is that it's so complex you need your team of engineers who doesn't really take it from Shopify. So kind of thinking big there, but I kind of have a sense of all the traits or features that it should have, the machine learning to be able to do best-in-class products.
FORMER DATA SCIENCE LEAD AT SHOPIFY
Just remember, like features are one component of it, right? Like the really hard part about competing with Shopify is the network effects, right? And those are hard to beat because network effects take a lot of time, and they have a compounding effect. Like the bigger the network is, the more people get added to it, and it just keeps going.
So a new platform may be able to come up and say, we have like a much better, like they may be able to shine on the bells and whistles of like we have better customer support and better search that will give you higher conversion rates. And like they may be able to list out all those things, but someone will still go just pick the bigger platform or the bigger network because they know there's more stability.
They know that when their website is down or they need a custom thing, it's going to be very easy for them to go and hire a Shopify expert who's like done a lot of implementation compared to a brand-new open-source implementation, there aren't as many people who had experience working with it.
So just keep in mind, those are all other factors that go into like if I'm a purchaser and trying to decide what e-commerce platform I'm going to go with, those are all like big things that weigh into the decision. And those are hard things for incumbents to try and build up, right? How do you convince people to go build integrations for your solution when people have multiple choices?
That said, over time, all the apps on Shopify, if they're looking for new opportunities, and there's a new platform, they may, if the numbers are there, they may start building apps for this other system. But it will just take a long time.
TEGUS CLIENT
Awesome. Thank you so much for chatting. Really appreciate it. Have a good one.
