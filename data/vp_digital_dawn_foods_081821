Appreciate you taking the time. To give you some background, weâ€™ve been spending time right now in the broader e-commerce platform, especially around some of these headless products that are on the market, and you came up as a customer of commercetools.
So wanted to get some perspective on what drove you to seek out a platform like commercetools, some of the evaluation you did and other vendors you considered and experience with the platform thus far. To start off, we'd love to learn more about your background and your role at Dawn Foods.
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
Sure. I've been in e-commerce for a really long time, 15-plus years, started out as a technologist, implementing e-commerce, e-commerce platforms, attached e-commerce technologies, and over time, I moved from a professional services role into a big four consulting role and then to the other side where I was on the client side, maintaining, enhancing e-commerce platforms, running e-commerce operations, then running e-commerce business, owning the P&L.
And in all of these roles I have been either using e-commerce platforms, choosing e-commerce platforms, evaluating them and being pitched different e-commerce technologies and services in that entire journey. I've worked with all of the major e-commerce platforms that are out there going back all the way to the ATG and Demandware era to the modern e-commerce platforms of today that are mostly headless for the most part nowadays.
I've run, like I said, technology teams, business teams, content teams, e-commerce operations, business operations, technical operations, being responsible for infrastructure, being responsible for site P&L, merchandising, pretty much any area of e-commerce you can think of I've worked in extensively over the years. Right now, I am the VP of Digital for Dawn Foods. I report to the Chief Digital Officer. Digital sits outside of IT at Dawn.
It's a separate organization by itself. And we have ownership of the Dawn e-commerce solution, full stack from technology and business, both sides of it. I also run the digital innovation hub for Dawn, which is a separate sort of entity charge with thinking about what business problems do we have? How do we modernize our business model and what do we need to do to keep our company running successfully for the next 100 years, how do we stay relevant in the business for the next 100 years.
We just completed our 100 years. This is our 101st year in business. So a lot of time had been spent in the last few years in looking at our business model, through a critical lens and trying to come up with an approach that allows us to remain in business and be successful as we've been for the last 100 years.
TEGUS CLIENT
Great. That's super helpful. So you said the Chief Digital Officer and this digital team that you're on, did you say that it sits outside of the IT organization?
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
That is correct, yes.
TEGUS CLIENT
And it also would be separate from marketing then as well. Is that right?
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
That is correct. We have CMO, CIO and CDO roles separately. The CMO role is not a C-suite role in the sense of other C-suite roles. Only the CFO and CDO are true C-level roles in our organization. They're the only ones that report to the CEO.
There are folks that have the CMO, CIO titles, but they don't report to the CEO directly. They report to somebody else and that person reports to the CEO, which is fairly traditional in a lot of manufacturing and distribution type of companies.
TEGUS CLIENT
And how long has the digital team and the CDO position been around?
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
So the CDO role was established in early 2019. We had an initiative internally that reevaluated what our overall strategic view was and strategic plan was several years ago. And out of that strategy work came a new strategy plan, strategic plan and there were functional cross-functional teams that were stood up to execute the strategy. There were several work streams in that cross-functional group.
And as these cross-functional work streams got going, they all basically had a lot of questions and touch points into a digital space. They weren't directly working on anything digital. So they felt like that was not the area that their team had core expertise in or their work stream had any expertise in, so they raised it up to the leadership steering committee of the strategy committee and the committee basically kept getting the same questions from different work streams.
And eventually realized that there needed to be a Chief Digital Officer role and a person and a team behind that person to support all this work because a lot of the work streams were having sort of the same type of conversations. That allowed the company to create this new role in late 2018, early 2019 and the Chief Digital Officer was hired in Q1 of 2019.
TEGUS CLIENT
Is the Chief Age Officer just as a strategy function? Or is it kind of like a technology with budget?
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
It's separate from the IT, the Chief Digital Officer owns the digital strategy for all of Dawn. We're a global company. We do business in over 110 countries. So the Chief Digital Officer's role is a global role and has team members in several different geographies. There are team members in Lat Am, in the U.S., North America and in Europe business units on the CDO has a separate budget outside of IT.
We interact and collaborate with IT quite significantly, as you can imagine. But the technologies and the tools we use are not determined by IT. The digital team aka myself and my team are responsible and accountable for choosing tools, technologies, platforms that we want to leverage. And we work on a doubt footing approach basically. We try tools and technologies, first and foremost, to make it work for ourselves on ourselves.
And if it works for us and works for our team, then we figure out can this scale to all of Dawn, can this scale all 5,000 Dawn employees? And can this scale to all Dawn customers. If there's a customer-facing application to that tool or technology or process that you look at. And we use those answers to determine whether something that we use and works for us can be recommended for broader adoption across Dawn or across our customer base. Collaboration tool set is a very common example that you would hear in that type of environment.
We looked at a lot of different collaboration tools. Atlassian was a better tool set for our team, but it's not something that the broader Dawn team really needs or uses. So we use it in digital, but we don't really use it outside of digital. Zoom, Skype, Teams, BlueJeans, Cisco were all evaluated for sort of the video conferencing solution, then we ended up recommending Microsoft Teams because we use other Microsoft services.
So there was a seamless integration between the folks in Boston and other team members, other Dawn team members that we needed to work with, creating a separate system just for the Boston team would not have worked well with a different system elsewhere. So we look at it thoughtfully and we come up with solutions that depending on the problem statement will work either laterally or bit more broadly. It just depends on the problem statement.
So that's really the sort of charter and mission for the additional innovation hub is to take business problems and think about them and come up with answers. Some of the business problems we've taken a look at and answered, have more technology whatsoever involved in them. We have recommended business process changes for Dawn in how we do certain things internally or how we work with certain customers.
And in the case of e-commerce, the question was how do we make our products available to our customers more readily and have them do a lot of self-service and move a lot of the questions from customer sales rep type of activity, in person activity and off-line activity to more online self-service type of a platform. The customers came to us with that ask saying, "Hey, I know I told my sales rep that I wanted something, but why can I not just place my order online?
Why don't you guys have in a website where I can place orders, look at my old invoices, look at the products I bought historically, look at your product catalog, et cetera. So our customers are asking for it. So we built an e-commerce solution that address those needs.
TEGUS CLIENT
So the commercetools spend, does that come outside of your budget or out of IT?
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
It comes out of my budget.
TEGUS CLIENT
And before commercetools, were you all using any sort of commerce platform?
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
No. We did not really have any sort of technology footprint, so to speak, outside of our core ERP system. We did not do e-commerce. We were completely a off-line business. The way we did business historically, before we launched e-commerce was we still have a large field sales rep team. They go to our customers once a week. Some customers are a little more frequently than once a week.
When they go there, they take a look at what this customer ordered last week and as they walk through the customer storage, they look at how much of it is left. And then they start writing down. Here's an order that this customer has to place to make their products in shelf for the next week. Our customers are Mom & Pop's Bakeries. So the cake mixes, doughnut mixes, filing, icing, glazing, anything that these bakeries need to make their products we supply those things to them.
So a lot of that was pen and paper being done manually. Customers would tell the sales rep, what additional things they would want. Our sales rep would know, for the most part what customers would need on a routine basis. So customers would add items to move certain quantities because in summer season, consumption is lower. So they tend to reduce quantities, in the winter consumption is higher so the quantities they order are higher.
So based on the season, the quality is changed, but any once in a while, they want something else for a onetime thing or they have a special order or bulk order or so they have to make more of something. So once in a while, they buy some new item or some new packaging, for example, a little more in quantity than usual. So the sales rep and customers have deep longstanding relationships. So they know each other well. However, most of our customers are bakery.
So they work in the middle of the night, a typical baker gets to work around midnight to 2 a.m. and is done with work by 10 a.m. in the morning. Our sales rep typically starts their day around 7 or 8 a.m. in the morning. And most of the times, they can only get to customers in the morning, so you have a limited window in which you can reach your customers. So if you're geographically spread out, then you may not be able to get to all your customers in time on any given day.
So customers had challenges working with the sales reps because of that sort of difference. So that allowed us to take a look at how do we reimagine this relationship because these are long-standing relationships. We don't want to disturb the interaction, but we want to improve the quality of that interaction. We want to make our sales reps be business advisers and not be sort of order takers.
The orders are routine, they're fairly recurring in nature, so you can pretty much predict to a 90% confidence what a customer will order in the upcoming week based on their history. You don't have to really have to send a person to take an order. So the relationship really should evolve as time goes on because our customers really need more of a business advice, what's the broader market look like?
What is the local climate around what's the competitive landscape looking like, which bakeries are coming, which bakeries are going? How are things moving in their market, what new products and services are we developing and offering and bringing it to market? What can we do to help them grow their business, and in effect, help our sales reps grow their own business, right? So that's really where we want to take the relationship between our customers and sales reps.
So a lot of that meant that we had to move the order taking capability out of the sales reps hands and put it into the customer's hands because they know what they have, what they need and all that. And there was no point in them telling a MSR or sales rep to then go place that order. So we wanted to provide that visibility. That's why we built what we did.
TEGUS CLIENT
Do you have any B2C facing functions of the business? Or is it all B2B?
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
We are purely a B2B business. We don't do B2C.
TEGUS CLIENT
Okay. And when did you evaluate these tools?
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
Yes. So we started a small sort of pilot initiative in 2018. We wanted to understand whether there was going to be a market adoption, them telling us that they wanted to do e-commerce is one thing than actually adopting and using the e-commerce site that we put forward is completely a different thing.
So we wanted to make sure that there was this adoption in our customer base and that they wanted this. So we launched a small pilot. We partnered with a small start-up, 4-person start-up that was doing a black box last mile e-commerce solution for bakeries. So we partnered with them to create a solution that sort of piggybacked on their platform to allow our customers to also do ordering.
And we opened it up to a very small number of customers less than 100 customers to see how it worked for them and what reaction would they have? What feedback did they have? What do we need to do if you were to build something. So when we launched that pilot in 2018, a lot of that was black box. We did not have access to any of the code or technologies and whatnot. So what we were really interested in that is wasn't the code or technology or anything like that. We were interested in the learnings from that pilot.
One, clear question we wanted to answer, is there going to be adoption? What business processes at Dawn need to be altered to be able to support e-commerce and what systems and tools do we need to have in-house to be able to support this. We could have just jumped right in, knowing e-commerce works. It's not an argument anymore, whether e-commerce works or not, everyone knows e-commerce works. What we wanted to now is does e-commerce work for us? Does it work for Dawn. What does Dawn need to do to make e-commerce work.
So that was the intent behind the pilot to learn answers to those questions and we found answers to some of those questions. So it gave us the confidence to move forward and build a Dawn centric fit-for-purpose e-commerce solutions for Dawn customers rather than rely on a third-party black box type of solution.
TEGUS CLIENT
Great. And so as you're starting to evaluate other products, what were the vendors you evaluated?
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
Yes. So I knew a lot of the legacy monolith e-commerce platforms have worked with all of them, historically, IBM, SAP, Salesforce, Oracle, you name, I have basically worked with all the major e-commerce platforms over the last 10, 15 years. So I wanted to understand what new cutting-edge means in the e-commerce platform space, but that did not mean we eliminated any of the big solution technology providers.
We kept all of them in the mix. We did a initial meeting and demos or a session, intro, post-demo type of session with all e-commerce vendors. We spoke to more than 10 e-commerce vendors, I think, at the time. This was late 2019 when we did all this. We talked to them, we asked them a few things. One, what does your product do? What does it do for B2B? And tell us what you released features wise, capabilities wise in the last 12 months and then show us your road map for the next 12 months.
The key really was not in looking at the demo or whether they had B2B capabilities. For us, the key was what is their previous 12 months of delivery and what is that road map looking like. When you put those two things side-by-side and a lot of companies have a very rich and robust roadmap. But when you look at what they've delivered in the last 12 months, it tells you a story, right?
If you have delivered two or three capabilities in the last 12 months, but your roadmap has 20 capabilities that you will deliver over the next 12 months, you know something is not right, unless they've hired 10x of their previous 12 months developer size. It's not realistic to expect them to deliver the 20 capabilities that they think they will. So we wanted to look at what each of these e-commerce platforms are doing.
We also wanted to know in terms of architecture, because some of them had older architectures. Are they keeping that architecture and enhancing? Are they reengineering it, reimagining it, rebuilding it or rewriting from the ground up, what are they doing?
By and large, there was no argument or debate over what all of these platform vendors are doing, regardless of whether they've been in business for four years or ten years? All e-commerce vendors told us the same thing uniformly, they are all making their platform capabilities, be available via APIs. The trend was to use API blank, insert your verb there, whether it is API-first, API-led, API-driven, API-only however we want to think about it.
That's how they all presented their platform and what they were planning on doing in the next 12 months or what they had been on a journey over the last year or so. So it essentially told us that there was no debate within the e-commerce technology vendor landscape. They were all doing the same thing.
They will all make their platforms be available via APIs. So that essentially the insight for me was that this is not a debate. This is not a headless versus monolith debate. The headless has clearly won as a preferred architecture pattern. It is not up for debate. Nobody is saying that monolith is the way of the future. They're all going away from the monolith, even the ones that are trying to sell the monolith are going to go away from it because that's what they're doing.
That's what they're investing in. So for me, the insight was that if the e-commerce platforms are all going to be API-driven or fully functionally available via APIs, we need to build an architecture for our own e-commerce solution that is compliant with that architectural pattern. We need to take advantage of the APIs and everything we build should also be available via APIs or just be APIs purely. So we came away with the microservices based architecture. Still, we haven't selected any vendors.
So what we did was we wrote up an architectural diagram that said here's an e-commerce platform. Here's how we will interact with that e-commerce platform, purely on APIs. Here's how we will interact with our enterprise ERP system and other enterprise services. And there will all be through APIs. There's going to be no other mechanism to interact between the client's platform and the external or internal platforms and technologies and solutions. They will all be API driven communication.
Because they're API doing, they can be drawn from a public cloud type of environment, which means we don't have to procure hardware and run things in our data center. So we wanted to completely be natively in the cloud as much as possible.
So we chose a public cloud that also was completely API compliant. In the process, we chose Google Cloud as our infrastructure provider. And we started to think about all of the cloud-native capabilities. I was not interested in being on the cloud, meaning I run my application as a monolith in a VM on a public cloud.
That was not my intention. I wanted to take advantage of managed cloud services like managed cloud database, managed cloud Kubernetes type of thing. So Google offered the broadest array of those kind of services.
TEGUS CLIENT
We're less focused on some of the infrastructure decisions and more focused on the vendor evaluation. So could you jump to who you shortlisted as considerations and the pros and cons of each and why you eventually chose commercetools?
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
Yes. So we ended up looking at a lot of different e-commerce platforms. The reason why I was talking about the infrastructure piece was that we needed to make sure that the base layer was right for us before we move to the commerce. So once we got the Google Cloud thing sorted out, we said, okay, who runs well on Google Cloud. What are these platforms out there that run well on Google Cloud. Commercetools obviously is run within Google Cloud, so you can much more easily access commercetools, you can access it very easily.
But a lot of the internal communication becomes internal within the Google network, so you get a much better reliability of responses within Google Cloud. That is why it was important for us. The other shortlisted vendors where Salesforce B2B Commerce Cloud, this is the CloudCraze as it was formerly known. And then we shortlisted Episerver and insightsoftware. Shortly at the end of our process, I think at the very end of our process, we learned that Episerver and insight were merging or Episerver was acquiring insight.
So we essentially, there were two separate companies, two separate products, very different roadmaps and technologies, but they merged and became one company. Anyway so we looked at a lot of different ones, but we shortlisted to these four. The way we approached this was we had a demo script that we gave each of these 4 vendors, the demo script was tailored to Dawn requirements. We gave them a bunch of use cases in that step.
We gave them the core-based data that they needed to sort of make the demo happen. And we asked them to do a demo of the script that we give them step-by-step to show us the viability of their platform for our requirements. So based on that, we saw commercetools as the much closest fit to Dawn requirements than any of the other vendors that we had.
TEGUS CLIENT
Can you elaborate a bit on what that means closest fit to Dawn requirements?
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
So a lot of our use cases were based on how B2B companies work. In a typical B2B, you have one product cataloged. Each in the catalog, there's n number of items. Each item is available to all of their customers. So they typically have one price. So all of their customers have the same price. It doesn't matter from a fulfillment perspective, you will sell all items in your catalog to all customers.
In a B2B scenario like us, the product catalog is specific to a given customer, meaning you as a customer has a certain number of items that you have access to somebody else, also a customer of ours in a different region of the country has different items that they have access to. So the product catalogs that you both as customers have from Dawn are different. The pricing is also negotiated. You have a different price than me or some other customer, right?
So there's a lot of complexity. There's contractual pricing. There is negotiated pricing. There is regional pricing variations. There are market factors in some markets, some commodities are higher priced. So our price for those items are different. So all of those variations make B2B e-commerce much more complex than a standard plain vanilla B2C e-commerce. So we needed a e-commerce platform that had flexibility and capabilities to be able to manage catalog in conjunction with users and distribution centers.
We need to be able to geographically segment the catalog by customers. And then we needed to be able to have multiple prices for the same item in the catalog. In fact, our catalog is pretty small comparatively. We have about 10,000 or so SKUs in our catalog. But the pricing runs deep, we have several million prices in our price statable for a very small 10,000 SKU catalog, right? So you can imagine the orders or magnitude of customer pricing combinations are pretty high.
So we needed a way and a platform that would accommodate that one-to-many type of complexity and be able to deliver for the right price, show the right price or the right customer at the right time and be able to persist that, calculate the part and all that. A lot of the e-commerce platforms, specifically the B2B ones do offer capabilities to some extent. But eventually, they throw their hands up and say, this is not possible within our platform. You have to sort of customize all this.
Once you start customizing the price, you lose a lot of the core capabilities of an e-commerce platform. You cannot do any kind of coupons, promotions, type of activity. You cannot do any of the cart calculations within the commerce platform. You have to sort of externalize and customize all of those capabilities.
So the purpose of having an e-commerce platform is going to go down the amount of use cases that your e-commerce platform will support becomes narrower and narrower as you start customizing and externalizing the capabilities, the core capabilities of an e-commerce platform.
So in some of those use cases, commercetools allowed us to manage some things internally within commercetools, the catalog, the customers, the distribution centers, the segmentation could all be managed internally within commercetools. But the pricing could come from an external system and could get fed into commercetools cart and commercetools would then be able to apply all of the promotional capabilities.
We did not have to sort of build anything to customize promotions or build a third-party system to do promotions or anything like that. We could take advantage of most of commercetool's capabilities.
TEGUS CLIENT
So you don't have a PIM or anything that manages the catalog that's sending commercetools. And it sounds like the pricing is handled by a third party vendor, who's that vendor?
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
So no, we have a PIM where we collect data via GDSM or directly internally and enrich the data. We have that PIM. We push the data from the PIM into commercetools. That is core product data. That's basically the details that you see the name, the images, the description, the attribution, the spec sheets, doing addition labels, allergen information that kind of thing.
So we have PIM in place for that. The pricing is maintained and managed within our ERP. We don't externally use any other third-party to manage pricing. We export that pricing information and we process that in an external database and we built a small microservice on top of that to support commercetools.
TEGUS CLIENT
Got it. Can you walk us through very quickly what the commerce tech stack looks like today, if you've got commercetools at the core as the engine, sounds like you have a PIM as well. What are the other products that you have and then also the vendors that you use for those various products?
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
Sure. We have commercetools at the heart of everything we do. We have a PIM. Salsify is our PIM that we use for, more than just a PIM for syndication and they just acquired a supplier portal company as well just yesterday. So there's some additional things that we're excited about with Salsify but that allows us to streamline our product data collection from vendors.
And then we have a headless CMS that plugs into this ecosystem. We use that to do all of the promotional content, the static content, messaging, any of the marketing information that you want to put on there, any of the feed or content, all of that is in the headless CMS. It's a CMS called heart and stack. And then if we act JS based single page application front end, custom-built homegrown by ourselves.
We built that clearly, where our experience is differentiated from a sort of a plain vanilla e-commerce experience for our customers, and we use a automated QA service, AI-based QA service that does the QA on a scheduled basis.
TEGUS CLIENT
Got it. Can you talk a little bit about the implementation of commercetools? How long did it take, how many resources, all that kind of stuff? And what are the products that you guys had to deploy alongside to kind of get your service up and running?
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
Yes. So we had to do a whole bunch of things simultaneously because we did not have any of these platforms that I mentioned in place when we started. So we had to implement PIM, Salsify, we had to implement the content stack CMS. We had to implement commercetools. We had to build our front end. We also had to architect how Google Cloud would work for us. So we had to do all of these things at the same time. So it was not just purely an e-commerce website building activity.
We had to stand up the PIM for so that we could go collect the product data from across the organization and from vendors. We had to stand up Google Cloud, so we could have development environments and create all of the infrastructure that we needed for all of our different environments and whatnot. So all of that worked almost running in parallel work streams. And we had no requirements, no code, no team, nothing when we started this process in October.
By the end of December, we had finalized all of the vendors, contracts and everything. We had signed contracts with almost all of our vendors. And the only contract that was unsigned in the end of December 2019 was our systems integrator. And that was just purely legal back and forth, not really anything to do with selection process there. But once that contract had executed within 22 weeks, we went from no code, no team, nothing to a fully functioning website that was available to customers.
The team was roughly 45 people full time working on this. I count 45 in a way that is probably slightly skewed to a higher end of this because not all of them are working on the core e-commerce site itself. Some of them were doing data. Some of them are doing content creation and content publication, the content management, those kind of things. So they were not really core e-commerce people there in that 45.
TEGUS CLIENT
What was the hardest part of the implementation? What was like the long pole with the product or?
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
COVID. Yes, really COVID because we started in January 2020. And I was at a conference in February, I was flying back and I flew through Chicago, Atlanta and Boston to get there and get back. And it was eye-opening to me that Chicago was half empty. And Atlanta Hartsfield was almost deserted when I was returning and I've never seen Atlanta like that ever.
So as I walked through Boston Logan, Logan was pretty much it goes down. And I had never seen Logan like that. And to me, that really reinforced that COVID is here, COVID is starting to make life impossible as we know it. So we have to do something about it. And so immediately, I got back on a Thursday and Friday, we told our teams that we are going to work from home remotely until we decide otherwise.
And we had to send everyone home, and we didn't know when we'd come back. We really did not think about how we will work remotely, et cetera. First, we wanted to make sure people were safe for us. So COVID had the biggest impact on us because we had to do a bunch of things and scramble to make sure that our teams could collaborate effectively and could work regardless of where they were.
TEGUS CLIENT
Assume COVID never happened. What then would have been the most difficult thing for you all during implementation?
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
If COVID never happened, we really didn't have anything major to deal with. I mean, you're running to some piece of content not being ready, those kind of normal things. You're running through some supplier not having the right images, right quality images. These are all simple problems. The biggest thing that we spent time on, on any of these things was designing our price microservice, and that was a 2-day effort for architects to get in a room, hash it out and get out with a design that everyone agreed is the right thing.
So that was our single biggest task in everything we did. Designing one microservice because it had to efficiently receive several million prices, persist and expose that in two or three different ways. So just to create that design to two days for our team. Otherwise, we never ran into any major hurdles like that? Obviously, there's a lot of work involved in this kind of project, right, but that's just normal work. You have to just do the work.
You have to secure your environment, you have to run on the security scans, you have to make sure everything works. You have to make sure the data is correct, all the data, the customer names, customer numbers, customer IDs, et cetera, is correct. But those are just standard processes.
TEGUS CLIENT
And can you speak to the role of the SI that you used and whether they were influential at all and you selecting commercetools and any of the other vendors that you ended up purchasing?
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
No. So we chose commercetools first, and then we looked at who are the SIs that have experience in implementing commercetools and who have done projects successfully and launched customers. So they did not have a say in the commerce platform itself. We wanted to make sure that, that decision came first. And then as we picked the other platforms, we kept asking all of the SI contenders to make us aware of their experience with each of the finalist platforms.
We had two different CMS vendors that we had shortlisted. We had a couple of different PIMs. And we basically asked the SIs to provide detailed explanations on what they've done with each of these platforms or what their level of experience was. Who were their clients that they could reference and that we could speak to?
Have they done any of these at a single client of theirs and so on. So we basically came away with a SI that was a partner or a premier partner to all of the vendors we chose. There were several others, but the one we chose was probably the one with the deepest experience with all of them.
TEGUS CLIENT
Got it. And how do you think about pricing and budget for these tools and then also associated ROI with that budget?
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
Yes. So one of the keys for us for Dawn was that this needed to be not a cost center forever, where we spent $120 million or $150 million, like other B2B companies historically would do and never see a ROI on this. We wanted to make sure that the cost of these platforms and tools and technologies was not significant. In fact, we were not getting locked in into a multiyear or proprietary type of a contract.
That was one of our key decision points in going with commercetools because it was all API-based and the APIs are well documented. You can pretty much switch to any other e-commerce platform that fully supports or provides APIs. And you would not have to tweak your front end as much as you would just have to do a little bit of work on the back end to repurpose what you already had to move from existing APIs of commercetools based APIs to a different third-party e-commerce platform.
So that flexibility was important to us because we did not go in, into this process, thinking this is our eventual permanent, long-term e-commerce stack forever. The way I think about it is technology evolves pretty rapidly. And the stack I am selecting in 2019 is probably the stack that I need for the next three to five years, given our size, given how we planned on growing and all that. So it needed to serve me between 2020 and 2025.
And I need it to be able to have enough capabilities now that I could take significant advantage of what they already had, but also leave myself with enough headroom so that I could grow and take advantage of some of their other features and functionality. So a sweet spot would have been something about 70% to 75% range of capabilities that we would use now and another 20% to 25% that we could take advantage of as we grew and grew our e-commerce footprint and added more e-commerce capabilities and services online.

And so how much are you spending a year on commercetools at this point?
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
I can't really disclose the exact spend.
TEGUS CLIENT
Even a ballpark range should be super helpful.
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
Yes. So a 5-year commercetools contract was less than a one year spend with Salesforce. So Salesforce put forward a 3-year multimillion dollar contract. And commercetools was well within that. It was a fraction of that number. A 5-year contract was a whole lot less than what we would have spent for just one year in, it is a 6-figure number. It's not even a 7-figure number now.

And the apples-to-apples comparison, I'd assume, would commercetools plus Salsify and some of the other vendors that you bought. Was it still cheaper to bundle everything alongside commercetools versus paying for just Salesforce?
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
Yes. No doubt. Overall, we don't spend anywhere near $1 million a year on all of the software platform subscriptions, not even close to anywhere near that kind of number. We would have paid over $1 million for Salesforce in the first year.

Got it. Anything now that you've been using commercetools and have it up and running, anything from a product perspective you've been disappointed with or which was improved?
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
Yes. So there are a few areas where they provide basic capabilities. Search is a big example of that. They have a basic search functionality and search capability. But once you start to get into a little more of a deeper search use case, especially in the B2B world, there are a lot of complexities in search and commercetools struggles to handle that. And there are ways of solving this with additional coding on top of commercetools, you can accomplish all this.
But you would expect or you would want some of these to be natively provided by your e-commerce platform to be fair though, there is no other e-commerce platform that comes anywhere close to achieving the same kind of search functionality with their search implementations either. So it's kind of gaps like that.
They also focus primarily on core e-commerce capabilities and leave a lot of white space for digital marketing efforts. We don't really get a lot of capabilities out of the box with commercetools on digital marketing, which is a pretty significant area.
Once you get to a certain size, digital business, you're really not going to add a whole lot of new functionality and capabilities to your site. Most of the work you're doing is in digital marketing in new acquisition, monetization, et cetera. And in those areas, commercetools does not have native capabilities.
They prefer to work with vendor partners for that space. I'm not saying that's right or wrong. I'm not saying that's good or buy. That's an open area within that platform and for the most part, that is true of all of the other headless commerce platforms as well.

If you were going to give commercetools an NPS score, just scale one to ten, one being it's a piece of garbage and ten being it's the best product I could ever mention. What would you give commercetools?
VICE PRESIDENT OF DIGITAL AT DAWN-FOODS GLOBAL
I would give them a score of somewhere between nine and ten. There are some minor issues or minor things. There, for example, they don't have dedicated 24/7 phone support that you can pick up a phone and call someone. The search, the basic search capabilities that I mentioned about a lot of those things, they provide you enough capabilities to get started and go a long way.
But if you want to be primarily reliant on commercetools, there are a lot of open areas where you'll still have to rely on third parties or build it yourself or just additional marketing is a good example, right? Either you have to build it yourself or you have to just keep waiting and hope commercetools does something and it's not their bread and butter, it's not their core, so they probably won't do anything in that space.
So those are some of the areas to think about for commercetools to figure out how they can make things better for their customers. And obviously, they are a headless platform, so there's no head and you have to build your own head or if you're in the B2C space, that life becomes easier because there are a lot of commerce kind of end as a service companies, Frontastic, Vue and Mobify, although Mobify has just been acquired by Salesforce.
So there are that planned as a service sort of frameworks and companies that you can rely on and leverage and make things go faster. I said we did our implementation in 22 weeks, if I had to start over again and do this, we could probably do this in 16 weeks or even faster.

Great. It's all super helpful. I appreciate you taking the time and answering all of our questions.
