TEGUS CLIENT
Thanks for taking the tome to speak today today. We’re looking at the broader e-commerce enablement and infrastructure space, specifically some of the enterprise commerce platforms out there, and you came up as a customer of Commercetools. So if you wouldn’t mind taking a moment to briefly go through your background that would be very helpful.
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
Yes. So I've been in the, I guess, Canadian retail and business base for 20-plus years now. And most of my time has been in retail. And some of that time has been also in roles outside of marketing, including IT and merchandising. So my background covers off areas outside of marketing that really does lend itself and help within the marketing space.
I spent 4 years in the media space as well. For me, that was a really great experience as a marketer because it also gives you a true understanding, deep understanding of particularly not just the traditional media space, but the digital space, which has become more and more important from a performance marketing point of view to understand when you're trying to support e-commerce platforms and e-commerce growth within your organization.
And so I've held various marketing roles that span across pretty much all the functions, not pretty much all the functions and currently at Rosen, I cover off-brand marketing, product marketing, our CRM and loyalty team, obviously, e-commerce and our creative studio.
TEGUS CLIENT
Great. And can you give us some more detail on Harry Rosen as a company, rough scale, geographic footprint? And then how much of the business today is online versus off-line?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
Right. So we are a private company, so I'd be careful about how much I share, but we are the largest menswear or dedicated menswear retailer in Canada, particularly in the luxury space. And our geographic brick-and-mortar footprint covers all provinces from Quebec westward. We don't have any physical locations in the East, but obviously, our e-commerce business covers the entire country and shipped to all provinces.
And even the Northern ones, we do have some customers up there, believe it or not. And the e-commerce business right now, we kind of look at like most retailers, e-commerce as a store. And it is the largest store it actually had in the last year. Probably as a direct result of COVID, but also as part of our growth strategy plan represents our largest store.
We've grown the business by 3x in the last year. And pretty much we quoted in the media actually in a press article that we've actually hit our 2023 target in 2020. So our targets now are even more aggressive, and we would attribute much of that growth to the platform that we did through with commercetools.
TEGUS CLIENT
Got it. And are you able to give us just a rough high-level sense of GMV across the business today?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
Well, so we're under $500 million, if that makes sense. But in the last year, obviously, our sales in brick-and-mortar has drastically declined. So it's not a typical year for us to really speak about store sales. We do expect to rebound, and we're hearing in some countries, a rebound of plus 25% to pre-pandemic sales. So we're scenario planning for all of that right now.
TEGUS CLIENT
Got it. Awesome. That's super helpful. And so what did your commerce platform or tech stack look like before you purchased commercetools? Were you using a commerce platform before that?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
Yes. So we were on Hybris like many others. We were on Hybris. And I think what's pretty typical over time, and I joined the organization just under 2 years ago. And we had been on Hybris for a long time because it's part of our ERP system. And so naturally, we moved into higher berths for our e-comm platform and had been on that platform for, I think, about 7 years.
We were doing some of the updates, and then it got to the point where it was getting really expensive to do some of those updates. We didn't do all the updates, and we got to the point where the site performance was so slow and horrendous that we could see it really impacting bounce and conversion. So we embarked on a journey to find a new platform. And we considered a number of different platforms, but decided strategically that we wanted to go with a headless approach.
TEGUS CLIENT
Got it. And your Hybris deployment, was that on-prem? Or did you have it in the cloud?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
No, it was on-prem. So we've now since moved everything to cloud, and that was another obviously, foundational initiative that had to happen in parallel with this, but everything has gone to cloud now. We were on-prem before, and that was part of the reason why we were also very, very slow. So we had a bunch of like, I guess, piping to do in the background as well from an overall system perspective and, of course, from a data perspective as well.
So everything is on cloud. We did evaluate Salesforce. We looked at, obviously, Hybris again. We looked at Shopify. I think we looked at a couple others, but those were the main areas of focus for us, and we really like commercetools.
TEGUS CLIENT
When you were thinking about vendors or the process, more like the top 3 things you said, this next platform like this is the top 3 things we're going to filter for? Because there are so many platforms out there, right? I don't know if you had a prioritized list.
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
Of course. Yes. Of course, there are so many platforms and everyone comes at you the second bit, anyone catches wind that you're even exploring. For any space. But for us, just going to back up again, maybe talk a little bit about Harry Rosen and experience.
If I back it up, Harry Rosen has been around for 67 years. We're not a new business. So we're kind of a Canadian fixture, that kind of wear Canadian fixture. Everyone in Canada, if you're a man, you would know the Harry Rosen brand.
We've got a wonderful legacy brand affinity and brand trust is very high. Brand awareness is very hot. But our experience has grown over the years as really more a brick-and-mortar experience. We're a very high-touch business. Obviously, you have men coming in to get suits measured, tailored suits measured and also consultations with their advisers for their style. So we operate a very high-touch business.
And the challenge with high-touch is how do you digitize that experience. So we took a step back and looked at what do we want to build here? We want to build and experience that is not necessarily a mirror image of the in-store experience from a high-touch service, advice, curation point of view, relationship point of view. But we want to make sure that we're building an omnichannel experience that takes the best of what we view in store as part of our traditional business model and bigger.
How does that play in the digital space plus add innovation to it and give our customers things that perhaps they didn't know they wanted or any piece of experience that they hadn't thought of. So we also have done customer journey mapping exercise in parallel with this. We ran that in parallel. I mean, ideally in the perfect world, you've run that first and then you go and find the perfect e-commerce tool. But nobody in reality, had the luxury of that type of time.
So we decided strategically that we wanted to launch with an MVP, which we did through commercetools. We used Bold Commerce as our checkout solution. And looked at that, like I said, in-store JIRNI and determined which areas we needed to address digitally. So we added JIRNI, as an example, as our equipment booking tool, right, which didn't exist.
And the idea was to go out and find best-in-class tech and tools to API with commercetools to provide that end-to-end customer experience that we felt is above and beyond our competitors. Obviously, that's always a work in progress because we constantly get technology companies who now have heard us talk about head list come to us and say, "Oh, I have this for you. I have that for you."
And the challenge I find sometimes when you have like a Salesforce, everything is mapped out and it's like they have their JIRNI, right? Like we're in the driver's seat more than anybody. Does that make sense?
TEGUS CLIENT
Yes. So yes, but there's a lot of different solutions that clean, they're modular or even like come prepackaged with a lot those pieces already built in there. Is there a reason why you kind of felt that you needed a commercetools kind of have this architecture to achieve those objectives of having a really personalized user experience?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
Exactly. Exactly that. We didn't want an out-of-the-box experience that everybody else would have. For us, we have a differentiated experience of the business.
TEGUS CLIENT
So you don't think the other stuff -- you customize to create a unique experience. Is that the way to think?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
Yes. It wasn't that you can customize because you can customize anything, right? You can build, right? But we didn't want to be bound by the infrastructure and the structure of -- I mean, that was already pre-mapped out that was too similar to others, right? And then from there, you had to then go customize the heck out of things to make it custom. We thought let's get the base model and let's do all the add-ons with best-in-class.
I think, honestly, I think it's a more innovative and entrepreneurial approach than perhaps some others. We felt confident in our ability to go and find those things and map them. We're very confident in our current business model, like we understand our customer. And I think that a lot of this comes from the confidence in understanding our customers and going out and finding and building them the best model of a digital experience rather than being tool, like we have that experience.
And so when we talk to some of the others, it just felt too much out of the box that this is for more a mass type of experience that it's okay if it's not that differentiated at a mass and mid-tier, mid-market level. So because we're in the luxury space, we wanted that to be differentiated. And then, of course, comes the cost, right.
Some of these other platforms are just extremely expensive to begin with, and then you go and customize and that gets even more expensive. We thought we price ourselves out of the customization that we needed just by getting basically the basic experience that everybody likes to get it. Does that make sense?
TEGUS CLIENT
Yes, it makes full sense. So 2 questions as a follow-up to that is, I mean that requires a bit of in-house expertise, right, to take commercetools, And then like pull together the other pieces you talked about and just kind of curious of that experience. Do do you guys have a pretty extensive IT organization?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
Yes. We did that.
TEGUS CLIENT
You did that? Okay.
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
Yes. I ask that question sometimes myself. I'm just joking. We're not a large organization comparatively speaking. I come from very large organizations. And I've learned and found it's the opposite.
When I was at Sobeys, I actually implemented Salesforce there, not from an e-comm perspective, but I did lead the initial scoping and RFP and implementation of Salesforce Marketing Cloud and customer service cloud and sort of e-DAM and some of those elements. For e-commerce, we actually went with Ocado.
I'm sure you heard Ocado. They're U.K.-based, and they have like an end-to-end solution. It was really what we needed also was like the distribution logistics piece of it, the warehouse build and all the way to the connectivity to the user integrates and the technology.
So that was a very different approach, but it was also for a very different business where you're talking about fast-moving products with temperature sensitivity, et cetera, right? So very different type of business. So here, actually, we don't have a large team. I do find that, that is a challenge for us.
So I take on part of that role, like, because I have an IT and have implemented systems over the years. I bring that customer lens from a journey and integration point of view. We have a strong IT department, not large, but a very strong IT department.
So I would say we credit it to the structure in that we've got strong leaders who get the requirement for integration and most large organizations would employ an SI to come and help with that. And we did as well. We are working with MyPlanet. They basically were our SI on this project.
So we didn't do it all in-house. We did get some external help through MyPlanet. Again, didn't go with one of the big consulting companies. We went with an organization that matched our need for agility and speed and expertise.
TEGUS CLIENT
And well, how did you hear about commercetools? It seems like you know Salesforce from your prior job, but commercetools is probably newer name. Did you hear about them through SI or?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
No. Well, actually, yes, we heard about them through MyPlanet. They suggested commercetools. So yes is the answer, it's through an SI, and I think honestly we consider ourselves mid-market, right, in terms of 5.
And I find here as a CMO here versus other larger organizations, I get solicited by so many who are start-ups or smaller tech companies who started to make a bit of a name for themselves but are looking for customers who can start to bolster their roster and their portfolio. And we've been a really great target but also partner where it's been mutually beneficial.
Because we have this thing in beta we want to test out, willing to give it to you, I guess, at heavily discounted price. I'm not saying specifically commercetools but some of this did apply. But in general, that we're finding that there's some synergies there because we also have a very strong brand that then gives them a really great case study at the end of it.
TEGUS CLIENT
Yes. So I guess I was many of the other folks when we poke around commercetools kind of type of customers, they got to be larger, like pretty large-scale implementations and lots of different moving pieces, complex environments. So that's why I was kind of just curious how are you guys able to digest. It sounds like you guys are pretty technical. It sounds like you have a pretty good relationship with them. Is that right?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
Absolutely. Yes. They're great. And I mean we have a very, proud to say, and I believe we have a very strong executive leadership team that we're a good balance between, obviously, the high-level leadership and strategy. And also we've got the technical know-how and have been through a lot of these types of implementations in the past.
And so when I joined the organization, like there was a lot of discussion around my involvement in not just martech, but obviously the e-comm report into me because there is this opportunity to connect the voice of the customer, if you will, with the actual P&L and operations of the e-commerce site, which obviously includes the technology and platform aspect, right?
So we just, in the press last week, announced our expansion into the grooming category, and we were able to do that, I'm going to say from start to finish, I think it was like a 4-month lead time for us to get convictional who's our drop-ship partner, API-ed and up and running with commercetools and Bold. And I literally just had the conversation with the team to congratulate them because it was honestly relatively seamless and one of the most seamless implementations and launches I've done.
TEGUS CLIENT
Yes. You don't have any IT resources reporting to you, do you?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
I mean I'm the CMO, so I don't. But I do have a business development manager and an operations manager that obviously, they're connected. And I'm obviously a key stakeholder within the digital product team, who was almost like that blue between IT specifically and the business stakeholders who ingest all of our requests, ingests all of our needs on a regular basis the way we structured is it not dotted line, but I'm a stakeholder for him.
So we work very closely on prioritizing the needs based on what marketing and economy, which is great because I get to then see the broader picture because, of course, oftentimes, these requests are connected. And we start at a very high level and go through. But because of that relationship, I think it's actually a critical piece to actually having that glue.
TEGUS CLIENT
But would you recommend commercetools to another retailer your size that they didn't have?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
Oh, yes.
TEGUS CLIENT
But do you think they need to have kind of that connectivity to the IT org and those type of digital savviness? Or because a lot of folks may just end up using like a BigCommerce or something that's a little more out of the box. And I wonder what the gap is, right, for an organization that's not like huge, right?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
Yes. Well, I do find sometimes the larger organizations actually end up spinning their wheels more because they don't -- no, I'm not criticizing. I'm speaking from experience where it takes longer because you have so many more stakeholders and not everybody has an understanding of the technology and what it takes to implement.
And then in that case, it's almost like less control in the sense because you have some of the specialized in a specific area, but doesn't understand another piece. And so you need to make sure you're still in those larger organizations that you have a leader who understands the business more broadly and how to implement technology because this is part of our digital transformation overall. And I think, honestly, that has been critical for us.
You're asking me if we would recommend commercetools to an organization of our size. I absolutely would and the absence of what we just talked about having the internal folks, there are integrators and commercetools themselves, we are really happy with the support that we received from them. In fact, I just signed off on a case study that they wrote on our implementation.
TEGUS CLIENT
Interesting. Yes. With commercetools?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
Yes. I just worked directly with them on a case study actually. So this is why I was comfortable talking about this because all this is public. We're very proud of it, and we're actually very happy to support them because they have been really great partners for us.
And I mean, of course, we've had some challenges too, like all implementations. I don't think you can ever say there's an IT implementation that's gone 100% smooth without any bumps in the road, but they overall have been very attentive and from an SLA point of view has been there for us.
But I think if you don't have people in an organization, whether it's our size or larger, and I actually would recommend commercetools to a much larger organization. We're not working with them because they can only handle smaller organizations, I think they actually have a really bright future ahead of them in terms of their growth in that you just have to make sure you have a client who understands and is willing to take some risks and try new things.
Because it's just folks who maybe have not heard of commercetools might not understand the space that well and I think there's actually more of a knowledge gap in terms of like understanding even what this means. So if you don't understand what that means, you're not going to appreciate not just commercetools, but a bunch of the options in the headless space, right?
You probably won't be as open to a bunch of other technologies in general. You're probably going to lean more towards a "safer bet" or someone who has more of a full-service approach, but then you're going to be bound by all those things we talked about before.
TEGUS CLIENT
You mentioned at the beginning that you credit commercetools with a lot of the success of the e-commerce operation. Can you elaborate a little on that and what the things, in particular, that commercetools enables that's driven some of the growth?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
Right. So let me just back up on that. So just to be clear, there were a number of factors at play. So last year, we had no choice but to like move everything to online. Last year, I think we were closed for a long 5-month streak the first time when we went into lockdown here. And we are in a province within Canada that has been the most conservative about lockdown. We've been locked down the most across the country.
So we had no choice but to figure out how to grow e-comm. There's no silver bullet, right? At the same time that we knew that we needed to re-platform from a marketing perspective, we also stood up a number of different functions to help support driving those sales digitally.
I set up a performance marketing team. We were going through a restructure anyway and it changed. And so we turned everything upside down and basically started from scratch. And so you can have an e-commerce tool in sight without proper support and without someone looking at how to drive traffic to the tool itself isn't going to drive traffic on its own, is it, right, or convert on its own?
So in parallel with that, we had to stand up digital marketing in general, excuse me, and specifically digital. We had a different vision and new vision on how we were going to measure success and it needed to be tied specifically to the business forecast and outcomes. We revamped our brand and content strategy.
So we increased the amount of content that we produced by at least fivefold. And also implemented a number of other tools to help with e-mail campaign management, content search was a big piece of that. We offered out-of-the-search technology and a number of other things. So this didn't happen just on its own. But in terms of site performance specifically, yes, absolutely commercetools on its own helped the site performance and conversion on site.
TEGUS CLIENT
What do you see are the biggest trends in the category? You've been doing this for a while from a technology perspective. This headless thing sounds like it's a pretty big deal. But like what's driving people to reevaluate their commerce platforms? Or are they not? Or is it just kind of like a normal evolution? Is there anything going on that's kind of cool?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
Yes. Well, just context setting, like I kind of divide this into like 2 like types of companies, right? Companies who have been around for a long time, like Harry Rosen, 67 years. And I think if your e-commerce platform, let's say, and I'm just going to throw a number out there, but I'm sure I'm being more generalistic about this.
But like you've had an e-commerce platform that was developed 5 years or more ago, right, you're probably on an older platform, you're probably on the legacy, you might be on a proprietary, you might have started implementation and you didn't quite finish it. And so call it like 3 to 5 years or longer, you're probably due for a re-eval of your entire end-to-end.
And a lot of the times, I found in conversation with other peers in our industry and others who have an e-commerce business \like we also might not have been disciplined with like the hygiene of the update that were required and the hygiene of just all the piping and tooling in the background. So now you have a site that doesn't performance as well.
And you know as a consumer, and I know as an industry expert, like going on the site, like these people must be on Hybris. So these people, there are certainly some issues on the back end. And I'm finding that, that some of these organizations haven't woken up to the fact that they actually need to probably change over the expertise internally as well because they're just used to doing things in a certain way.
And then you have the new entrants and a lot of these older organizations and particularly in the Canadian market, I'll speak to Canadian market, who went on a digital transformation journey or hadn't started updating their e-commerce platform, a lot of those ones are not here anymore in the last year, have announced bankruptcy, they relied heavily on the brick-and-mortar stores only and didn't have a plan to update their back end and their experience.
They're either struggling or they've already announced they've exited the market or they're finally figured out how to do it quickly. And so that has created opportunity for a bunch of new entrants. Obviously, there were some who are already here and some who are already more e-comm, there are a few retailers that can think of off the top of my head who I look to, and I think these folks have figured out how to really stay on top of their e-commerce experience.
They're adding new features or adding new functionality. They're making returns easy. They're adding to their loyalty program. They're making it easy for me to access my account and understand what I've purchased and the experience is very seamless. There's almost like a night and day right now with that.
And what I have found though is that it's kind of what we've been talking about a key theme for me and a key theme I talk about often on panels is, you need to make sure you upscale your people and your team because it doesn't matter if you've got a commercetools or a Salesforce or whatever, and I found this also from one of my previous organizations that if you don't upscale your people, they're not going to be able to figure how to use the tools to optimize.
And so that's one other theme around just making sure that the knowledge share and the teaching and the learning from the team is a big consideration when you're going through that type of transformation and update. And we had one of the RFI and one of my previous organizations come and do a team-wide kind of just training session.
It was over 3 days and it was expensive, but we invested in it because there were people who didn't understand what conversion like basic metrics that in the digital world didn't understand how digital marketing work, didn't understand some of the terminology within the e-commerce platform space. So I don't know if I'm getting off topic for you. So you want me to stop, I can stop, but I'm passionate about that one because it's like buying a car and not knowing how to drive it. Should I stop there?
TEGUS CLIENT
That's helpful. If you think about like the commercetools, what were the other things around it that you were like, "Hey, it'd be really important that they have good integrations with?" Do you know what I'm saying? Like, what are the other pieces that are really important?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
Yes. Well, I think I already spoke to some of them. Because like I said before, we launched with MVP. So the checkout experience a big one, obviously, right? And that did run smoothly. For us, appointment booking was really important because we do have a digital selling team, which is really more of a remote selling team and obviously, in-store advisers and so connecting that experience to make it more of an omnichannel experience was important. We have added other features like Shop So a lot of the on-site merchandising functionality they've been great with adding features to.
TEGUS CLIENT
Was it pretty out of the box in terms of like it was pretty -- the partners all had their stuff well curated so it would plug nicely into commercetools?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
Yes. I'm going to say yes and no. Yes. So the ones I just mentioned were pretty out of the box. Returns was the other one I was going to -- obviously, a seamless return. So we're now working with Narvar for returns. And so the ones I just mentioned were pretty out of the box, but then we've also experimented with trying to mimic that adviser experience online for the curation of sort like a survey tool.
"So tell me why you're here? Are you here for an event? Are you here for work quotes? Are you here just for casual, you just want to update your casual weekend style?" And so we worked with an AI company that offered like a customized solution that they created for us. I mean obviously, there was an out-of-the-box component of it, but they tailored it to us.
And so we like organizations like that comes to us with "We have thought about a customer problem or issue or opportunity. We have a solution and here's the base line and here's what we can customize." We like that because, again, as I referred to it before, you want to make sure that we are offering a customized solutions.
We looked at kind of like the mirror type of technologies, and we're looking at those type of things right now to help with not just experience but to get you to the merchandise on site quicker. And then search as well has been another one that has been critical for us. But I would say that one was pretty much out of the box also.
TEGUS CLIENT
Can you speak to the implementation process? I know you mentioned starting out with an MVP, but how long did the overall implementation take? Do you have a mindset that was, "I want to completely rip and replace Hybris on one motion?" Or was it more of a gradual process? Can you elaborate on that?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
Yes. It was a little bit of both. So we didn't do a formal RFP. We did the search and exploration phase. Let me just take a step back to count like make sure I'm giving you this accurately. So we didn't have as much of a sense of urgency, let's say, compared to post-pandemic.
So pre-pandemic, probably that exploration was a 6-month exercise as we were moving into scoping and specs and really signing off on the SOW and working with our SI and with commercetools to get everything in order. And then we had started the implementation prior to February of 2020.
And then once the pandemic actually hit in March and we went into lockdown, we then had some serious conversations with the team. And at one point, from March, we're like March, April, May, like could we get this done in 4 months? Because at one point, maybe we could do this through June and it turned out, obviously, because we were originally supposed to launch in the fall of last year.
So we ended up accelerating the launch by 2 to 3 months and launched early August of the re-platform. So that was our time line. So if we wanted to shorten that, we probably could have tightened up the early phases, but we just had some other priorities.
TEGUS CLIENT
So just on understanding the time line, it sounds like it took you roughly 6 months once you start building to get up and running?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
It was 6 months when we got really serious about the build. But like I said, the whole process could have been tighter on the front end, but in hindsight, we could have tightened that up. It could have been much quicker.
TEGUS CLIENT
And the August launch, was Hybris at that point completely turned off and no longer a factor? Or did you still have it running simultaneously?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
No, we turned it off. I can't remember the exact flip to switch date, but we did put the switch off in August.
TEGUS CLIENT
Got it. Okay.
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
Yes. Obviously, we ran the test sites in parallel for during our testing phase, and then we crossed our fingers and flipped the switch and everything seemed to work fine.
TEGUS CLIENT
Yes, sure. What are things from a product perspective that you think commercetools could improve upon or that you haven't been as satisfied with?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
To be honest, there aren't really that many areas that we're not satisfied with right now. We've had a few service issues in the last couple of months where the site has been down. I would say that to me, I kind of want to call it reliability issues where the site has stopped performing and in some cases, I think someone made a mistake.
In other cases, it couldn't figure out the issue and it was another time there was a global issue. So we were given a heads up. But they've been pretty good about making it good for us. So we've had some downtime for various issues. Some of them were as a result of like their systems. So that's been my biggest complaint, but every single time, obviously, we've had no issue escalating, but obviously, nobody ever wants to be down.
TEGUS CLIENT
Yes. And then if you were to give kind of an NPS rating on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being "this is a piece of garbage" and 10 being "this is the best tool I could imagine," what would you give commercetools?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
Yes. I'm going to give them an 8. I don't give anybody a 10. I think there's always room for improvement. But I'm going to say, we're pretty satisfied with how the launch that we're getting a lot of positive feedback from our consumers, and it's been very positive.
So the price, they brought the price down a lot for us. But it's also just a piece of the tech stack. There are a number of other elements that obviously, if we didn't invest in, we wouldn't be able to launch with commercetools.
TEGUS CLIENT
Got it. Great. Those are all of our questions. Is there anything else that we haven't chatted through as it relates to commercetools or some of the other commerce platforms in the market that you think is worth mentioning at the end here?
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SVP MARKETING & ECOMMERCE AT HARRY ROSEN
Well, I think the one thing I would say, continues to be, I think, an opportunity for us in retail is that omnichannel experience in connecting now your e-commerce experience to the in-store experience. I don't think anyone has nailed that. I think that's something that we're trying to sort through and figure out. And like I said earlier, I don't think it has to be like a one-for-one like-for-like experience.
So it definitely has to be thoughtful and has to be developed with the customer in mind so that there's no friction. And that is something that I think retailers need to remain focused on. And as we've all been investing and developing on the digital front, we cannot forget that brick-and-mortar experience because the customer generally travels between both channels.
