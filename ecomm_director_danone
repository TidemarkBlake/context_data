TEGUS CLIENT
Hi, thank you for taking the time to speak to me today. We are trying to get smart on the kind of e-commerce website building space. And it seems like you have a very relevant background, given your set of experiences. And so excited to get the chance to chat. I think, obviously, we're looking at platforms that it sounds like you know pretty well. And so would love to kind of dive in, first, maybe with a bit of context on your background. And then we can speak to some of the platforms, I guess, Shopify, Magento, and commercetools, would be great.
GLOBAL ECOMERCE DIRECTOR EDP WBU AT DANONE
I'm the eCommerce Director at Danone, the dairy specialized nutrition and waters company. Okay. I've been here for two years. And in my role, I oversee everything related to e-commerce, okay, from the more omnichannel players like Walmart, Tesco, et cetera, to the new commerce delivery space like Instacart or the pure players like Amazon, Ocado.
Plus, the direct-to-consumer experiences that we have with our specialized nutrition side, with some things that we are doing with some of the issues we cover in the U.S., et cetera, and where we use these kind of technologies. But it's mostly in our specialized nutrition business that we use these kind of technologies and in the waters business a little bit also.
Previously, I used to work at Unilever for three years. And I did pretty much the same, but for the tea category. So, for brands like Lipton, Tazo, et cetera. And within that, of the brands, it's called T2, an Australian brand, but that's direct-to-consumer, where we use also one of the tools that we may be discussing today, Salesforce.
And previous to that, I used to work in a start-up in London as head of e-commerce I was in charge of all the end-to-end. In that we worked using Magento and then Shopify. And before that, I used to work at Reckitt Benckiser in two different roles, one very similar to what I do now; and another one that was rolling out worldwide for Durex, direct-to-consumer, where we used Magento, Shopify, Hybris tools.
And previous to that, I used to work in consultancy, okay, doing e-commerce and digital projects. So, I was on the other side of all this coin that was implementing what the customers wanted, working with big ones in Europe customers like that. So that's a little bit in a nutshell my experience. And I tried to give you a little bit of a snips of what I used to do.
TEGUS CLIENT
Yes, that makes a bunch of sense. And so, I guess I'm curious, in your current role, do you guys have your own e-commerce like websites and solutions? Or are you mostly using other people's and selling on other platforms?
GLOBAL ECOMERCE DIRECTOR EDP WBU AT DANONE
So, most of the stuff that we do in e-commerce, okay, through omnichannel and pure players, so we have a division that is called Specialized Nutrition. And it's a division that we have most of our direct-to-consumer website. That's because it's the one that makes more sense. So, it's baby formula, okay, mostly. So, we have that, for example, in the U.K., direct-to-consumer. We sell that in Australia direct-to-consumer. We were going to start in the U.S. with a brand called Happy Family.
It's a small part of our business today, but we do. And I think it's a quite interesting one. We are using an ecosystem of things. Here, in the Specialized Nutrition business, we use commercetools, okay? It's a fabulous solution. Again, I can explain a little bit more later. And then in the waters business, we have some local kind of things.
So, for example, we have a project called Vase Group, in Paris, where we sell Evian water directly to consumers, or in Spain with a local brand called Font Vella. And we are using Magento in the other one. So, we use a little bit of everything. That's something that we are trying to make a little bit of sense out of it, okay, because it's not doable.
And in the past, the same in Unilever. So, in Unilever, it was mostly an omnichannel play, but then we had brands, okay, that were direct-to-consumer like Dollar or for example, in my case, T2 in tea. And while in the start-up that I mentioned, 98% was direct-to-consumer. And in Reckitt also, most of what I was doing in my last post was direct-to-consumer.
TEGUS CLIENT
That makes total sense. So, I guess, I'm curious, it sounds like you're using commercetools today.
GLOBAL ECOMERCE DIRECTOR EDP WBU AT DANONE
Yes.
TEGUS CLIENT
So, I'd love to hear a little bit more about kind of what you're using it for. And obviously, there's a ton of platforms to choose from. Kind of what drove the decision there?
GLOBAL ECOMERCE DIRECTOR EDP WBU AT DANONE
So, we are using two platforms here, okay? One is for the Waters business, we are using mostly Magento, okay? And for the Specialized Nutrition business, we are using mostly commercetools. And why it's a difference is because with commercetools, you might be familiar with a term that is called headless, okay, headless commerce platform or eCommerce platforms.
So, while it's a very small part of the business itself, the eCommerce bit in Specialized Nutrition, the really important thing is the data. It's the whole thing. We have clubs targeted at moms, et cetera. So, it's really important to us to have like an ecosystem and integrate all of that within the consumer journeys.
So, we needed a solution that would sell. And at that point in time, that was at the beginning when I joined the company, there were not that many that excelled at being headless eCommerce solutions. That's why we chose commercetools, because it had one of the better headless propositions at that point in time. Things have evolved. Okay, Shopify has it now. So, there are a ton of them that do it today.
And on the other side, on the waters business, we didn't need that. We are using Magento. Because it's more a stand-alone eCommerce website, typical eCommerce website. But what drove the decision, in this case, was the headless proposition of commercetools was more powerful than the competition at that point in time. And from a cost perspective, it was also more doable than other solutions, if that makes sense.
TEGUS CLIENT
Yes. So, I guess, obviously, so if I'm hearing you right, at a point in time in which you were building this, commercetools was really out and front in terms of being both a headless solution, but also pretty cost effective. If you are making the same decision today, has there been improvement enough in the other players that you would make the same decision today? Or how do you think you'd think about it now if you're building it from scratch?
GLOBAL ECOMERCE DIRECTOR EDP WBU AT DANONE
So now we are trying to reassess all of this, okay, to make it more like one solution across the company, because you can imagine, in a corporate like us, the complexities of managing different technologies in different countries. So, one of the decisions that we have taken, and it's more driven not only by the direct-to-consumer proposition but for the B2B propositions. So, we are trying to build, and you might be familiar with this that a lot of companies like us are trying to build B2B capabilities or digitalize the route to market, what it's called B2B.
And for that, we chose Salesforce. And likely, we are going to move all of the systems to Salesforce, because Salesforce or it's the one that has a score better to try to do B2B and direct-to-consumer at the same time. So yes, at this point in time, the solution might be another one that is not commercetools.
Because one thing that we found out is like headless sounds very ideal and when you see it in a PowerPoint, this will integrate very seamlessly with your CMS, et cetera. But then it's a little bit more complicated than all of that. So right now, we are trying to kind of reformulate everything to bring it all under the same platform to try to bring cost efficiencies also.
Because you can imagine, the IT people don't want to have like thousands of solutions to maintain. Right now, they have to maintain Magento, they have to maintain commercetools, et cetera. So today, we are changing platforms really. So we have already chosen.
TEGUS CLIENT
So, you're switching off commercetools completely?
GLOBAL ECOMERCE DIRECTOR EDP WBU AT DANONE
Likely, yes, it will be in our road map. It will not happen one day to the other, okay, but likely, yes. It will be years to get it switched.
TEGUS CLIENT
How painful is it to switch off?
GLOBAL ECOMERCE DIRECTOR EDP WBU AT DANONE
Okay, probably you will need to call me in a couple of months, because we just started doing this. This is the first thing. But I can answer to the question in a more generic way, if you want, because I've done this in other companies. So, for example, when I was at Reckitt, we moved from Magento to Hybris. It was really painful and really costly.
It was a decision made by IT to integrate better with our internal systems. But it was very painful because it was renewing the whole site in another technology, finding out things that we could do on the merchandising side, et cetera, that we could not do now; doing an integration, again, with a third-party logistics; doing an integration with a payment gateway.
Some people tend to oversimplify how difficult it is to switch these kind of providers. And in a company like us, it's not easy, because there are a lot of things that need to be integrated for it to work. When you are talking of a start-up, it's a whole another game. I've done it in the start-up. For example, we moved from Magento to Shopify.
And I'm not going to say that it was easy, but it was not painful either. So, we managed to do it in a very straightforward manner. But in corporate, it's a very painful process. And usually, when you buy one of this, you try to stick to it, okay, just because the changed management of it, it's complex.
TEGUS CLIENT
Yes, that makes a bunch of sense. And I guess, just to understand, I mean, obviously, it sounds like you're switching over to Salesforce, because it kind of better unifies a bunch of things you're trying to do. But I mean, what was like the top reason that commercetools isn't cutting it anymore, I guess, for what you need to do?
GLOBAL ECOMERCE DIRECTOR EDP WBU AT DANONE
It's not that it's not cutting it, but we need to switch to a solution that allows you to do B2B in the best way. And commercetools was not specialized on the B2B. So, what we have managed to size up is right for us. The biggest opportunity is not direct-to-consumer. The biggest opportunity is B2B. And for B2B, you need another kind of capabilities and way of structuring the site, et cetera, that is different to other eCommerce site. But we wanted something that provides both of them.
Commercetools was much more focused on the direct-to-consumer kind of propositions. And we thought that it was not the best solution for hosting B2B and B2C sites. So, we wanted a more unified platform that could do both things. And for us, that was Salesforce. And also, you need to be reminded of the game.
Salesforce were very interested, because they don't have enormous customers. So they were very interested in reaching an agreement on price. So, the tool was cheaper than you might think of. So that's what triggered also the solution for us to say, okay, it makes sense that we move to a more professional one.
But having said that, it's going to be painful for also, because commercetools right now is very embedded on the Specialized Nutrition systems. So, it connects to the CRM. It connects to a bunch of things that the connection is going to need to be built up and tested on trial. And the security is going to have to get tested again, et cetera. So, I can tell you, this was more a top-down thing that we did from the global team. The local teams will have preferred to just go with their solution.
But the problem when you work in a company like this is like the local teams don't realize often most have been created by allowing every country to do their separate team. As I said, the waters teams are on a platform that is Magento, but just to give you a sense of this. Now you roll out a security update, that we had to, because Magento, as you know, probably has a lot of security issues, for example.
You need to roll out different things in every place. So, in Australia, they have a version of commercetools in a sense. Then in France, they have a version of Magento. In Spain, they have another one. The U.K. has a different thing. It's something that the team was not very fond of because at the end, you have a security problem that could become really meaningful. And you probably know GDPR and this kind of laws around Europe.
And we saw that it's not worth the risk of doing so. We need more like a standardized process that then if we roll out an update, it updates everywhere and we can do these kind of automated things. Because that definitely makes sense for a small part of the revenue. So that's mainly the reason of moving. At the end of the day, commercetools, they can't fulfill fully what we thought that we needed as best-in-class for B2B plus. It wasn't more what we were looking for at this point in time.
TEGUS CLIENT
That's super helpful. And so, I guess going back to the consumer world, obviously, that reason makes sense. But I'm curious on like the B2C side, obviously, I think Shopify, pretty dominant in the market. I'm curious how you think about why and where commercetools makes more sense for a business than Shopify today?
Obviously, I understand that in the past, commercetools had this headless capabilities and Shopify did not. It seems like Shopify has been building some of that. So curious as you compare those two businesses today and think about when someone would be a good fit for commercetools, like why would someone be a good fit for commercetools today? Or what would they be looking for particularly?
GLOBAL ECOMERCE DIRECTOR EDP WBU AT DANONE
Well, I think that there is a big difference when you classify the customers, because they said, yes, this is Shopify, it's a very mainstream thing today, much more than in the past. But not in the corporate world. Corporates still, they are not that fond of Shopify, because Shopify doesn't offer the service levels that someone like commercetools or a reseller of commercetools could provide.
So, when you think about corporate, they are going to be much more fond of a solution like commercetools or Magento or Salesforce, et cetera because they can have support, they have a level of security at the end of the day that gives them confidence. While Shopify is much more Software as a Service tool at the end of the day, where you pay a subscription. Yes, they have started to move a little bit towards the corporate world, but not yet.
Most of the things that are on Shopify are a small and medium business. Yes. Some of them are biglike Gymshark in the U.K., it's a GBP 500 million, they are in Shopify. But they were in Shopify when they were doing GBP 500,000 also. So, it has gone with them. But when you think about it, most of the corporates are not very fond of solutions like Shopify and especially much less the European ones. In the U.S., you have people like PepsiCo. They launched PantryShop over Shopify as a test.
But in Europe, most of the corporates like us are not very fond of Shopify, because the data store, for example, in the U.S. that doesn't comply fully with the laws in Europe. It's like a white space, let's call it like that rather a space. So that's the thing that commercetools give more confidence to a corporate. I don't think that the start-up will implement commercetools, really, okay?
They will go, all the start-ups that I know are on Shopify these days, okay, much more than in Magento or in other areas, while the corporate world is much more inclined to go to commercetools, Magento. Even Magento is a little bit failing off. We'll need to see how it will be managed. Or Salesforce or solutions that provide that service and provide them a level of security at the end of the day.
Also, because when you need to convince like senior management, one factor is the cost of the tools, but the other one is how reliable all of this is. Is this reliable? Is this what our peers are using? And you will not see almost anyone in corporates using a bigger scale Shopify.
So, I think that, that's the main difference. It's the kind of customers, while start-ups, I will tell you, directly go to Shopify. It's the best solution. From a functionality point of view, because they are not that many different. If you think about it, probably the headless solution is better on commerce tools.
But Shopify has started having that. There are plenty of modules for payments, for integrations. Building a team is much easier, I can tell you, in Shopify than it is in commercetools. But I think it has to do with that main difference really. One is more like Software as a Service thing, more targeted SMEs. The other one is probably more built for corporate, if that makes sense.
TEGUS CLIENT
Yes, that's super helpful. So, I guess I'm curious then, it sounds like it's not actually the functionality itself. When you talk about the kind of additional service, is that mostly around, I mean is part of that around like customization and actually commercetools tweaking things for particular companies? Or is it mostly just around support level, having that account manager, you can pick up the phone and call or someone that's on site? Or how do you think about kind of what's the most important?
GLOBAL ECOMERCE DIRECTOR EDP WBU AT DANONE
It is much more about the second one. From a customization point of view, okay, most of the people don't need as much, okay? And to be honest, Shopify has a goal to have a lot of integrations with systems, with ERPs, legacy systems, et cetera, that can be built at the end of the day, okay? So, it's not that much about that. It's more about the second part that you mentioned. It's more about, okay, we have a data leak one day, who do you call at Shopify?
Shopify doesn't have really an account management support at a level that the other corporates have. So, as you said, and you nailed it on the expression, it's more about the service, it's more about the account manager that you pick up the phone any day, because it has gone wild. And they will pick up the phone and you will have someone from commercetools or from one of their vendors, et cetera, solving it.
While at Shopify, I see that they are moving on that direction because I see them starting to have that, but they are not there yet. It makes sense because they are built for the mass and they are built for the SMEs really, not for corporates. But they are realizing more and more that corporates are interested about it. So, I wonder how long it's going to take to them to get into this.
Because you need to think that these are expensive solutions. Commercetools is a very expensive solution. Salesforce is a very expensive solution. Shopify is not as expensive. But you need to think that it's a change of mentality for the corporate to go to Shopify. Because when you go to a Software as a Service like Shopify, you lose control of where the data are stored, where is that server, how it works.
While on the other solutions, you can have that server at your data center with your other thing or in the private cloud that you have already, in an AWS or whatever. While here, it's much more, well, you give it to Shopify and they do what they do. It makes also the IT people less confident about, let's put it that way.
TEGUS CLIENT
Yes. That's super helpful. And I guess, how do you think about then kind of commercetools versus Magento? And like how you'd kind of think about when each product is a good fit for someone?
GLOBAL ECOMERCE DIRECTOR EDP WBU AT DANONE
So, I think that Magento is going to have a huge advantage over them, depending on how Adobe plays it out. Probably you know this, okay? Most of the people know this at this point in time. But two or three years ago, Adobe decided to buy Magento. And I think that, that's going to be fundamental of how they look at it, because I'm going to give you an example from Unilever.
We were already buying the DLP from Adobe. We were already buying the Target Tool from Adobe, that is the personalization tool. We were already buying the Adobe Suite, let's call it like this. So why will I buy commercetools if I'm already buying the data management platform, the website platform, the personalization platform from Adobe? If they offer me something that it's integrating eCommerce, I will take it, even if I have to make it the right size.
The point that I already decided that, hey, my solution is Adobe tech stack, I will move it. While commercetools doesn't offer us much, and they don't have the same power that Magento has. Again, functionality-wise, very similar. Commercialization-wise, not sure, because a lot of corporates already use Salesforce solutions. And our other competitors already use Adobe.
So, it will make these companies easier to integrate, because when you think about it, then you have CRM, then you have the DMP, then you have the e-commerce sites all under the same roof, all under the same tech stack, and that makes things a little bit simple in the corporate world, because everything is living under the same roof.
And also, from managing them because then unless you only have one partner that you need to talk to if anything needs to get fixed. You know what I mean. So, you know that you have a big contract with Adobe, that you can negotiate better, because you are using much more tools. And you have that level of support.
TEGUS CLIENT
So, it sounds like from your perspective of these top kind of companies, there's not like a huge amount of product differentiation, it seems like. The kind of the vendors you work with.
GLOBAL ECOMERCE DIRECTOR EDP WBU AT DANONE
Yes. And so if I can be honest with you, I will use Shopify in all of that. Shopify, for me, is the one that is cheaper. The total cost of ownership is much smaller than any of these tools. And for most of the big corporates, hey, it does the job. As I said, you can build websites, because in the past, I've heard a lot about Shopify, yes, but what about when you scale?
Well, there are plenty of people, I just told you about Gymshark. They scaled up to GBP 500 million. None of these corporates are making GBP 0.5 billion on sales on their sites, okay, and supporting the level of traffic that these people are supporting. So, you should have more than another Shopify, but I can tell you on the other side, none of them will move to a solution like Shopify.
Because inside of the corporate, it will not work. It's too much risk. Where we are today, it's too much risk for the IT department. Another thing is doing a small test in a company and doing some stuff, but for a wider rollout, it just never works. But for the rest, the start-up mostly, the solutions on how you manage orders, how do you manage the program? Yes, the programming languages might be different one to the other. But at the end of the day, they allow you to do pretty much the same stuff, okay?
So, it's not a big difference. And even if they don't allow you, for example, Adobe probably will integrate Target with Magento so it will allow you A/B testing and personalization. Maybe the other tools will not allow that straightforward. But probably you will have clients to do that. Or probably you can add on top of that, optimizing or other tools. So, I don't think that the functionality is as big a problem.
That's for the direct-to-consumer part. But when you think about B2B, it's a little bit different, because some of these, Shopify, for example, or Magento are not built for being a B2B platform. They are not built for that. Even if they have like ways of tweaking it a little bit, they are not built inherently to do that, okay, or to do both things at once, okay?
But for direct-to-consumer, it's pretty much the same. At the end, it's a front end, it's category-based, it's banners, some personalization around, it's some data capture with pop-ups, it's order management, it's payment processing. There are not heaps of difference, to be honest, between most of them do that kind of stuff.
TEGUS CLIENT
Is there any vendor in the space that you would be trying to invest in? Like if you were to rank your most long-term prospects in your mind, who do you think has the best prospects? And then who's second? Yes. If you were us, like who has the best growth path in front of them?
GLOBAL ECOMERCE DIRECTOR EDP WBU AT DANONE
It highly depends, if you ask me, the personal view or the corporate ones. So, for us, probably, we will stick with companies like Salesforce, et cetera. If I had to invest in someone that is probably going to win a lot of this space in the near future, I will invest in Shopify. And why is that is because Shopify has seen massive growth, on this space.
But also, I think that the room of growth that they have in front of them, it's amazing. Because as I said, right now, they are targeting mostly SMEs. But the corporate world, it's starting to get interested in them, okay, but they are not invested at that point. But think about all the room that they have if they are able to kind of go to that route, okay?
And the other part is like DRP is coming much more than just selling the technology of the Software as a Service that they have. They are becoming more as a platform. Now they offer like in the U.S. only, they offer like warehousing and third-party logistics. So, they are becoming more and more a one-stop shop. And that can become, at some degree, more interesting even to companies like us or to corporates.
And why I'm saying this, I don't know, you guys might be familiar with a British company called The Hut Group. So, The Hut Group is an e-commerce company, they have a platform called Ingenuity, where they do end-to-end services to brands like that. That has been interesting for us, because it's a good way of outsourcing direct-to-consumer without having to bother a lot about the programs that direct-to-consumer creates in a corporate like us.
You need to think that we are not set up to selling units to a consumer. We are set up to selling to companies like Walmart, and other companies like that are taking away the problem. I'm not saying that it's a perfect solution, not close to it, and I will not work again with The Hut Group after Unilever. But Shopify is trying to do something like that.
They are trying to create an ecosystem where you can plug in, and you could have not only the technology for the front end, but you could have also a warehouse, even they are thinking about doing customer service. You could start having like an ecosystem of services to do direct-to-consumer. And I think that, that's very powerful. And if they are able to packet or package it to corporates like us, we will buy it, because it's trendy also.
And we need to be mindful of certain things. So, if I have to pick some of this, I think that people like, as I said, Shopify are very well positioned in this world and to win in the future. And also, they appeal to different kind of customers. Smaller customers will never go to tools like commercetools. So, SMEs or small, that they could not be bothered.
And especially in the space where Shopify is very easy. You need to think that for implementing commercetools, it's not straightforward. So, you cannot do that without technical knowledge of someone. When you can launch a Shopify website in hours, we have almost any technical knowledge. So, I think that's a very powerful thing that they have. So, if I have to bet, I will bet my money on Shopify.
TEGUS CLIENT
Awesome. Well, thanks so much for taking the time. Really appreciate it.
